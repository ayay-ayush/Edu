<h1>Welcome to my Dream Project of helping 1.5B+ students</h1>  

We very well know this Education System is completely broken - from **learning useless trigonometric functions** to **studying the entire night for tomorrow's exam just to forget everything after that.**

The Schools and Colleges are focused just on *"fees"*, *"marks"* and *"a useless paper called degree"*.
I myself being a high school student, knows and understands the pain of 1.5B+ students all around the globe!  

Seeing every students pain suffering with stress and anxiety my only motto now on is: **either crib or fix."** - and I have chosen to fix the system, even if it takes years to built the best infrastructure and community.

<h2>My Motivation?</h2>

"MY" motivations are all around me!
```markdown
- **Every single comment in every video related to Education System on youtube and every other platform".**  
- **My younger sister who says she "hates algebra" and sadly asks "why can't kids choose those subjects which they love the most?"**  
- **Every single student who cries everyday thinking they are "useless" just because they can't score a hundred in every subject like the topper guy.**  
- **The tag stuck on students' face that making use of technology like mobiles and laptops are bad for a student.**  
- **Every single college passout engineering student who is jobless since they weren't "skilled enough" for any job - ironically, even after studying for 20 years!**  
- **Every kid who get rejected to spend anything on skill builiding courses with the tag of "you aren't studying enough!"**  
- **Every student who is tired of being compared to the neighbourhood studious child.**  
- **Every student who asks "Is this gonna be on test?"**  
- *... and the list goes on!*
```
<h2>Problems persisting since Industrial age</h2>

```markdown
1. **Rote learning**
  - We have progressed with time; however, we still have not been able to move away from rote learning.
  The students aren't actually "taught"; but are "fed" using spoons and forced to swallow down the throat and during exam, 
  the student who regurgitate most of the information - is only awarded.
  
2. **Worst Evaluation system**
  - We all have heard "Marks doesn't mean anything" or "A single paper can't decide your future".
  Well, if these all are true, and nothing good except stress and mental pressure comes out of "system of Marks" 
  - then we should definitely abandon this system and build up a complete new system of evaluation.

3. **Better training of Educators before recruitment**
  - Teachers play the most important role in schools and hence, they should be given the best of class training.
  After all, they are shaping the **future of the nation, the children.** 
  Untrained educators who only know how to ditch in assignments everyday without teaching anything is worthless!

4. **Introduction of technology**
  - We are living the renaissance of technology and in such a state, technology and education system cannot be kept apart. 
  Students must be taught about technology right from the early years of their education so that it does not come like an alien thing in their later times.
  Instead of distancing every child from technologies, saying it'll destroy their life - must teach them how to make the most use of it. 

5. **No Personalized education**
  - Education needs to realize that the absorption power of every student cannot be the same. 
  Hence, the teaching method also cannot remain the same for every student in a class of 40 students.
  Some students have faster learning pace and some are slow. Teachers must have a keen eye on observing each of their students.
  Assuming everyone to learn everything in a single night for tomorrow's surprise test is totally absurd - this makes students dull and un-motivated.

<h2>How I would tackle them:</h2>

As far as the brain of this 16 year old kid (ie, me) could figure and churn out every single details of the problems and its solutions, here are my key insights not only on problems - but more on its effective Solutions!

(PS. I could do the world out of it once I get really good people in my team to work out for every single solution together. I am currently actively looking for such people who resonate with my idea to bring about a positive change in the world! Currently I have a rough framework of what to do in days to come in my notebook spacing more than 21 pages of research of problems and solutions with sheer dedication and I'll try to type out every single idea of mine in this page.)

1. Tackling useless curriculum
  - I aim to make the future Education System as future ready as possible and that can't be done without restructuring of the backbone of schools - Curriculum.
   The curriculum must be designed [continue from here..]
