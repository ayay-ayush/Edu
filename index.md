<h1>Welcome to my Dream Project of helping 1.5B+ students</h1>  

We very well know this Education System is completely broken - from **learning useless trigonometric functions** to **studying the entire night for tomorrow's exam just to forget everything after that.**

The Schools and Colleges are focused just on *"fees"*, *"marks"* and *"a useless paper called degree"*.
I myself being a high school student, knows and understands the pain of 1.5B+ students all around the globe!  

Seeing every students pain suffering with stress and anxiety my only motto now on is: **either crib or fix."** - and I have chosen to fix the system, even if it takes years to built the best infrastructure and community.

<h2>My Motivation?</h2>

"MY" motivations are all around me!
```markdown
- **Every single comment in every video related to Education System on youtube and every other platform".**  
- **My younger sister who says she "hates algebra" and sadly asks "why can't kids choose those subjects which they love the most?"**  
- **Every single student who cries everyday thinking they are "useless" just because they can't score a hundred in every subject like the topper guy.**  
- **The tag stuck on students' face that making use of technology like mobiles and laptops are bad for a student.**  
- **Every single college passout engineering student who is jobless since they weren't "skilled enough" for any job - ironically, even after studying for 20 years!**  
- **Every kid who get rejected to spend anything on skill builiding courses with the tag of "you aren't studying enough!"**  
- **Every student who is tired of being compared to the neighbourhood studious child.**  
- **Every student who asks "Is this gonna be on test?"**  
- *... and the list goes on!*
```
<h2>Problems persisting since Industrial age</h2>

```markdown
1. **Rote learning**
  - We have progressed with time; however, we still have not been able to move away from rote learning.
  The students aren't actually "taught"; but are "fed" using spoons and forced to swallow down the throat and during exam, 
  the student who regurgitate most of the information - is only awarded.
  
2. **Worst Evaluation system**
  - We all have heard "Marks doesn't mean anything" or "A single paper can't decide your future".
  Well, if these all are true, and nothing good except stress and mental pressure comes out of "system of Marks" 
  - then we should definitely abandon this system and build up a complete new system of evaluation.

3. **Better training of Educators before recruitment**
  - Teachers play the most important role in schools and hence, they should be given the best of class training.
  After all, they are shaping the **future of the nation, the children.** 
  Untrained educators who only know how to ditch in assignments everyday without teaching anything is worthless!

4. **Introduction of technology**
  - We are living the renaissance of technology and in such a state, technology and education system cannot be kept apart. 
  Students must be taught about technology right from the early years of their education so that it does not come like an alien thing in their later times.
  Instead of distancing every child from technologies, saying it'll destroy their life - must teach them how to make the most use of it. 

5. **No Personalized education**
  - Education needs to realize that the absorption power of every student cannot be the same. 
  Hence, the teaching method also cannot remain the same for every student in a class of 40 students.
  Some students have faster learning pace and some are slow. Teachers must have a keen eye on observing each of their students.
  Assuming everyone to learn everything in a single night for tomorrow's surprise test is totally absurd - this makes students dull and un-motivated.

6. **And the list never stops..**

<h2>How I would tackle them:</h2>

As far as the brain of this 16 year old kid (ie, me) could figure and churn out every single details of the problems and its solutions, here are my key insights not only on problems - but more on its effective Solutions!

(PS. I could do the world out of it once I get really good people in my team to work out for every single solution together. I am currently actively looking for such people who resonate with my idea to bring about a positive change in the world! Currently I have a rough framework of what to do in days to come in my notebook spacing more than 21 pages (and counting..) of research of problems and solutions with sheer dedication and I'll try to type out every single idea of mine in this website.)  


```markdown
1. **Tackling useless curriculum**
   - I aim to make the future Education System as future ready as possible and that can't be done without restructuring of the  backbone of schools - Curriculum.
   The curriculum must be designed with every student in mind along with the incorporation of every digital aspect in mind. I am still working on a rough sketch of the curriculum and its a long one, so at present I'll first complete the prototype of it and try to present here later in a more visualised way for easy interpretation.

2. **Training of best quality teachers**
   - Before the recruitment of teachers in schools, they must be evaluated on the basis of their skills and humanitarian values and not just by seeing their degree in hand - (afterall, to make the world understand that a mere degree cannot judge any person - We need to change it!) and I will do it!

3. **Transport Facility for students**
   - I myself have suffered/ and still suffering for a better transport facility to reach school. Even though we have transport facilities, they aren't meant for eveeryone due to its highest price hikes. I plan to create a network of people all around India (and later around the world as well) who could lend their unused, idle bikes, cycles, scooters, motors, etc to help other students travel in a least possible fee base - so the Owner could as well get a small commisson on the distance covered and the parents could have a safer way to send their kids to schools without ditching thousands every month on transport facilities. BUT, this idea of mine has a complete different website, which I'll work on soon!

4. **Personlised Guidance** 
   - I can't even imagine the way it feels when kids are disrespected by the teachers themselves because they couldn't understand a thing/topic. Most of the teachers' behaviour towards students are totally dependent on the fact that how much the kid scores in their subject - which is absolutely absurd. Kids have their own capabilities and learning speed and without personalised guidance, kids will either *loose their track and walk on the wrong path* or *Sadly, they would surely give up everything thinking they're worthless in this huge world*.

5. **Main - Training of Parents**
   - In India, (and I say this with a very heavy heart..) when a kid is born, they only have 2 options on Earth - if boy, then "enginner" and if girl, then "doctor". Kids are made to believe that consistent First ranking in the class is the only way to have a bright future! I can't even blame our parents completely - the reason is that our parents were born in an era of poverty and without much opportunities, they could hardly earn their living, and all they want if a fixed income government job for their kids for a secure future but they don't understand is that the era has changed, and every kid has a burning flame inside them to do something really GREAT!   

   I being a high school student - will just after 2 years will be forced to go to college and waste 4 years of life even when I have a clear belief that I could and will bring a Positive change in the entire world! And sadly, I being an indian student can't do much about it - If I told my parents that I want to change the world, the first reaction would be "laughter" with one single line: ``` "Ayush, we as middle class family, can never be rich and only "rich kids" or "god-gifted" children can only do great in this world, You go and study sincerely and get a good job in multinational company and take us on a world tour." ```  
   I am so much highly blessed that I atleast have a computer to type my dream out - but imagining kids of my age who don't even have a mobile phone for classes makes me so sad.  

   Parents need to understand the fact that the world is changing and imposing their own dreams on their really passionate kid will make him another lost case among the millions of dreams dying after every Parents-Teacher Meeting Day in India!

   Even though I am highly confident about my dream and dedicated to change the world, I won't be surprised if someday I am be told to delete all these dreams out of my mind and start preparing for the entrance exams and *I'd be another lost case of a really passionate kid who "wanted" to change the world but was made to believe that a job is the best thing for a "middle class child".*

6. **Evaluation System**
   - The sick mentality of "Only those succeed who score good marks" is deep rooted in the minds of every parent. Ironically, Marks were designed to evaluate students - but guess what, a student's future is decided by a evaluation system given out by other human! It simply means its deep rooted that we measure our success rates on the basis of comparision of other's success. Students seems to be satisfied with a 40% marks if the topper's marks is 45%. 
   Better Evaluation System is one of the things which I'm working on along with lot of other things in my small sized mind! :)

7. **Cultural Development**
   - Students need to be taught the culture and ethnics related to their respected areas and nation/states. Real culture has a lot of value in every individual's life. A child must feel connected to their homeland even when they aren't in that place and to do that, we need to embrace cultural development of kids and teach them real "ART".
   ``` Afterall, EARTH without 'ART' is just 'EH' ```  
   I have a BRILLIANT idea here as well! - People who are really skilled in these topics are working hard in villages to atleast survive for a day's meal - We could give them employment and a better living income in return of them teaching kids about the skills. It'll be a win-win for both kid as well as the person! 
   [ Afterall, a smile is what I want on eveerybody's face :) ]

8. **Biological Knowledge and Safety**
   - I don't know why but people still have a profound taboo related to menstruation, sex and personal hygiene. Instead of fighting over religious ideas, we must incorporate these general life topics which will create issues in future due to lack of knowledge  among children.  
   "Half knowledge is more dangerous than simple ignorance" - Even after knowing this very well, we generally skip these topics due to embarrasment - which must not be the case!

9. **Rationale Thinking and Life Managing Skills**
   - I strongly believe that proving a Circle as a Quadrilateral in schools won't teach students about dealing with stress, relationships, time management, disturbed sleep cycles (its 4am here and I'm still typing), feeling of isolation, recovering from emotional pains and traumas. 
   Students need to learn how to earn money, apply for loans, knowning basic laws about your country, how to express their feelings and thoughts and become confident. Respecting every person as a human and not on the basis of race or colour must be at highest priority - and quality teachers are the ones who'll do so!

10. **Abandoning Tutions**
   - Ever wondered why students join tutions? - One line answer is = "OUR SCHOOLS AREN'T SKILLED ENOUGH". If the schools in this world were skilled enough, then no student would have a need to attend another 6 hour of useless coachings charging tons of money from every parent.
   I want my kid's as well as every single student's Monday to be a start of new revolution and not a sad feeling of "Ah, again schools!"
